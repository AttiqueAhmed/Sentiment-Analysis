Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral
# Project Details
In this project, we will do a sentimental analysis of amazon reviews. There are millions of reviews on Amazon and reading them one by one is impossible. We will make a model which will analyse the texts in the reviews and categorise them as either positive or negative.
Data: The has two rows and a million columns. we will use this data to train our model.
The data is taken from a trusted source and preprocessing is required before using the data.
Proposed Model: There are many machine models which can be used such as Naive Bayes, Long-Short Term Memory, linear regression and Support Vector Machines. We will use Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for our project as it gives better accuracy for such data sets.
After training the model we will check the accuracy and evaluate the model.
